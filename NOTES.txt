To Do:
* Map more closely to FIX messages
  * use quickfixgo
* support "subscribing" to executions from an exchange (and "executions"
  should correspond to the data feed from an exchange, so maybe quotes too)
* calculate market NBBO, spread, other metrics

Ideas:
* support inter-exchange connections similar to NYSE vs. BATS
* build variable-delay order channels
* figure out a way to create random information about a symbol and build algos
  around it

time orders reversed for different sides, but sorted by price

Market orders have no price control

Limit orders limit price, but can be "marketable"
  Can also be FOK (like market, but price stipulated) or AON (all or none)

"aggressor" vs. "resting" order
