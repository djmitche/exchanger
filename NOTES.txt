To Do:
* Map more closely to FIX messages
* support "subscribing" to executions from an exchange (and "executions"
  should correspond to the data feed from an exchange, so maybe quotes too)
* calculate market NBBO, spread, other metrics

Ideas:
* support inter-exchange connections similar to NYSE vs. BATS
* build variable-delay order channels
* figure out a way to create random information about a symbol and build algos
  around it

Build components which take incoming messages and can be given an arbitrary
set of outgoing bindings.  All of these should be exchanged in a simple but
extensible datatype.

Build an "exchange" component which maintains an LOB, takes mesages to manage
LO's and BO's, and sends status updates as events occur.

Build other utility components:
  wye (make copies of a mesage)
  http (allow incoming messages via HTTP post)
  fix-tcp (allow outgoing messages in FIX format over raw TCP)
  fix-websocket (FIX via WS)
  json-tcp (allow outgoing messages in JSON format over raw TCP)
  json-websocket (JSON via WS)
  delay (delay messages)

Build a registry for components' inputs to help with discovery

Build a way to create and wire up components based on a text file of some sort
