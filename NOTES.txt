To Do:
* Map more closely to FIX messages
  * use quickfixgo
* support "subscribing" to executions from an exchange (and "executions"
  should correspond to the data feed from an exchange, so maybe quotes too)
* calculate market NBBO, spread, other metrics

Ideas:
* support inter-exchange connections similar to NYSE vs. BATS
* build variable-delay order channels
* figure out a way to create random information about a symbol and build algos
  around it
